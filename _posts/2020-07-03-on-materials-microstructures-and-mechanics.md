**Hello World**

Recently, I've been working on a research project which I won't discuss yet. Some of the fundamental concepts essential to the theoretical aspect of my project that I've been studying for a few weeks are [elasticity](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/MIT3_11F99_elas_1.pdf), [stress-strain curves](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/MIT3_11F99_ss.pdf), [fracture](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/MIT3_11F99_frac.pdf), and [fatigue](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/modules/MIT3_11F99_fatigue.pdf) to name a few. These concepts are all with respect to how materials behave. I've learned these topics by taking heavy notes and working through the corresponding problem sets of each module in the [MIT OCW 3.11 Mechanics of Materials course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-11-mechanics-of-materials-fall-1999/).

Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to document the exploration of my ideas stemming from the modules I've already studied, but the good news is I'll be learning much more!

I've decided to learn about the mechanics of materials in conjunction to solid state chemistry to give myself a much more solidified, technical background in materials science and engineering for a particular portion of the research project I'm working on. While studying these topics, I'll document key modules I'm studying and explore some questions with my takes on them. If I stick to my schedule, I should have my first post exploring technical questions in these fields up in a week. As of now, I plan to do 6 weeks in a row, which means I should end on August 14th, 2020. Eventually, I want to get to the properties of nanomaterials. When I do, I'll do similar posts in terms of posing questions to analyze.
