Hello world, I've recently been studying the various types of defects that arise in materials. The topics I've been focusing on are point, line, and 3-D defects. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. What kind of stress would a lattice feel around a point defect versus a dislocation (line defect)?**

Firstly, point defects are impurities concentrated at a single atom space, whereas dislocations are impurities generalized to groupings of atoms in space. 

In point defects, different types result in different stress on the material. For a vacancy defect, the material would feel a tensile stress at that point in space because the atoms will naturally move to fill empty space. For an interstitial defect, the material would feel a compressive stress at that point in space because the atoms of the crystal must shift outwardly to fit the interstitial. For a substitutional defect where the substitute is an atom smaller than the regular lattice atom, the material would feel a tensile stress at that point in space for similar reasoning to the vacancy defect. For a substitutional defect where the substitute is an atom larger than the regular lattice atom, the material would feel a compressive stress at that point in space for similar reasoning to the interstitial defect.

Moving from point defects, edge dislocations result in two separate planes of atoms: one plane consisting of a dense cluster of atoms, while the other plane has one less column of atoms along the dislocation. The plane that is more dense with atoms experiences a compressive stress as atoms compete for space within the crystal lattice. On the flip side, the second plane with less atoms experiences tensile stress as the atoms creating the plane stretch space to fill the same space as the more dense plane.

**2. Why are defects present in a material?**

Defects are a consequence of the fact that materials are always agitated. That is, there is always some finite temperature K > 0, which always results in different orientations of the grains that make up a material. As the temperature of a material increases, the number of defects subsequently increases.

**3. Can we ever fully eliminate defects in materials?**

Realistically, we can never fully elimate defects in materials. Unit cell parameters in materials are on the scale of Avogradro's number, so there is always a non-zero probability of having an impurity in the formation of a material. Ideally, one could eliminate defects in a material if the material is created extremely slowly at absolute zero, but it is far out of the scope of any experimental work in the field so such a claim sees no real value as of yet.
