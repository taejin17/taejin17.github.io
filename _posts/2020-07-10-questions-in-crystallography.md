Hello world, I've recently been studying crystallography. The topics I've been specifically focusing on are crystalline solid structures, alongside learning all of the notation for defining crystal planes and directions. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. What does the (111) plane of an FCC lattice look like?**
t

**2. What are all potential body diagonals (what constitutes <111>)?**

**3. What kind of rotational symmetries are allowed in solid crystals?**

**4. Is 5-fold axis rotation possible?**
