Hello world, I've recently been studying the effects defects have on the plasticity of materials. The topics I've been focusing on are slip and hardening in materials. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. Can slip occur along any plane? If so, why? If not, why not?**

Slip cannot occur along any plane. Slip occurs along closed-packed planes and in closed-packed plane directions because a closed-packed plane has a shorter distance between atoms which corresponds to a larger perpendicular distance to an adjacent closed-packed plane. The larger perpendicular distance to an adjacent plane allows for an easier glide that is propagated by the shear stress. In FCC materials, the closed-packed plane would be of type {111} and direction of type <01¯1>. _Note:_ ¯1 denotes 1 with a macron on top. On the other hand, in BCC materials, there exist no truly closed-packed planes so there are many more slip systems compared to FCC materials.

**2. Does the slope of the stress-strain curve change during hardening? What affects this work hardening slope?**

The slope of the stress-strain curve does change during hardening. More specifically, the slope of the stress-strain curve becomes less positive during hardening (smaller corresponding slope value). Past the yield point, a greater stress applied to the material causes the formation of edge, screw, and mixed dislocations that interact with each other to form finer grain boundaries which results in less dislocation mobility, thus increasing the strength of the material. The stress on the material must increase to increase the material's strain because the work hardening makes it harder to deform the material due to the increasing presence of clashing and interacting dislocations.
