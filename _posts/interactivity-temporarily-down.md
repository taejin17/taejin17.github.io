**Hello World**

So this is going to be a very short post.

First, the public discussion forum for the blog articles I write is temporarily down. You won't be able to see any comments you've made on any of the articles or my responses to such comments. I'm working on some new pages/features/interactivity (whatever you want to call it) so it will probably persist to be down for the coming weeks. I've also archived a few older blog posts while I make changes. I'm not quite sure if those will be coming back, ping me if you want access to the archive.

Second, some updates since I've been away from writing awhile. I've been really busy these past few months, but I have some really cool content I'm writing while you read this post that'll be on nanolattices. Besides staying on top of schoolwork, I've been doing quite a lot of work outside of school. I'm currently wrapping up a project by writing up documentation and building a Weibull distributions interface. This interface will draw from the calculations of a graphical user interface that visualizes and analyzes material mechanics. I've also been working with a team on reinforcement learning, predictor, prescriptor, and visualizations models that examine the effect of various NPIs on regional COVID-19 cases. Moreover, I've been working with another team on the research and development of a vaccine distribution plan and co-authored a paper set to be published soon. I'm taking a few courses outside of school which should finish around March, but I'll be sure to publish some articles here before then.
