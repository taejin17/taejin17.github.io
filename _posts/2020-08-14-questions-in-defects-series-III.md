Hello world, I've recently been studying defects at a slightly more macroscopic scale in terms of combining various dislocations together. In particular, I've been focusing on grain boundary effects. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. Why are grain boundaries so different than dislocations in their response to mechanical loads?**

Edge, screw, and mixed dislocations create slip ssystems that allow plastic deformation caused by mechanical loads past the elastic limit to propagate. These dislocations interact within individual grains so the propagation of deformation is smooth. Grain boundaries make the crystal structure function as disoriented slip systems that interact at different, colliding angles. Different lattice orientations of individual grains caused by such grain boundaries results in the pile-up of dislocations that hinder each other. The concentration of dislocations at grain boundaries makes it harder for the material to derform given a similar mechanical load since slip systems are not allowed to propagate at the grain boundaries. Unlike independent dislocations, grain boundaries are not as efficiently packed (that is, less free volume) and take on a much more amorphous structure. There is also the crystalline grain phase, which is the grain boundaries phase where the transition between different oriented grains occurs. This transition can only propagate when grains align, which only occurs after a certain load is applied in a certain direction, whereas dislocations allow propagation as the planes tangentially slide until meeting an intersection dislocation.

**2. Why do different rates of loading a material affect its mechanical properties?**

Faster load rates correspond to higher strain rates, which favors the elastic properties of a material because less energy is absorbed due to the shorter time span given within the faster load rate. The elastic properties of a material correspond to strength and stiffness, so these properties in the material would increase. Also, the material's toughness would decrease since it fails at a point of much less energy absorbed over the same duration as the slower load rate.  Slow (quasi) loading rates allow materials to act as though they are in static states, giving the material time to relax. Faster load rates may allow grain boundaries to dominate rather than just a single dislocation. The faster load rates also result in dynamics of the material, particularly the shock factor on impact.
