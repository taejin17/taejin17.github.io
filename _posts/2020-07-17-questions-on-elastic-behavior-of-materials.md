title: Questions on Elastic Behavior of Materials

Hello world, I've recently been studying how elastic behavior arises in materials. The topics I've been focusing on are the in-depth implications of Hooke's law and the atomic basis of materials. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. Why can we treat a material as linear elastic at low displacements?**



**2. Why would we use stress and strain rather than load and displacement?**

**3. Where would true stress be more useful than engineering stress?**

**4. How would engineering and true stress change if we have a load applied sitting on a group of pillars (all of different diameters but closely bunched) and some of the pillars fail before others?**

**5. What are the competing forces that vie rise to the equilibrium bond length?**

**6. What does the shape of the bond-energy curve tell us about how a material behaves?**
