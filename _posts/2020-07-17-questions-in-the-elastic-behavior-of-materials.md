Hello world, I've recently been studying how elastic behavior arises in materials. The topics I've been focusing on are the in-depth implications of Hooke's law and the atomic basis of materials. Here are some resulting questions with analysis:

**1. Why can we treat a material as linear elastic at low displacements?**

At low displacements (from initial resting state), experimental data has demonstrated that most materials exhibit Hookean behavior. That is, most materials are linear elastic up until threshold values where various deformations such as plasticity or necking occur.

**2. Why would we use stress and strain rather than load and displacement?**

Load and displacement are dependent on material properties such as cross-sectional area or specimen height. However, stress and strain are ratios that describe the load and displacement properties of materials but are independent of the material itself. Thus, stress and strain are useful for examining unknown or new materials due to their material-independent nature.

**3. Where would true stress be more useful than engineering stress?**

If there is a plasticity deformation in a material such as necking, true stress better describes the stress acting on the material during the necking process than engineering stress because it accounts for the instantaneous smaller area present in necking. If engineering stress would be used in the case of such a deformation, the stress would be smaller than the actual value because the engineering stress uses the initial larger cross-sectional area of the specimen.

**4. How would engineering and true stress change if we have a load applied sitting on a group of pillars (all of different diameters but closely bunched) and some of the pillars fail before others?**

As more load is applied to the structure, the engineering stress increases with the constant cross-sectional area of the intial group of pillars, so the structure experiences a stress value lower than the actual true stress because it does not account for the increasingly smaller cross-sectional area.

**5. What are the competing forces that give rise to the equilibrium bond length?**

Simply put, attraction and repulsion forces give rise to the equilibrium bond length. Take, for example, NaCl. The attractive force is largely present between the close Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> that alternate along the crystal lattice, and is accounted for at farther interval distances but in increasingly smaller amounts. The repulsive force is also present between same sign ions nearby, and dissipates outwardly but is still allocated at a point location.

**6. What does the shape of the bond-energy curve tell us about how a material behaves?**

In the bond-energy curve, steeper bond functions are associated with a deeper well, so within similar classes of materials the Young's modulus tends to correlate with energy needed to rupture bonds (for instance: by melting). That is, the deeper the well, the greater the energy needed to break bonds. Another way to look at it is that materials with many bonding oribtals and few antibonding orbitals (e.g. Tungsten) should have deeper bond-energy curve wells, with correspondingly higher stiffness and melting temperatures.
